                Get an authentication token for API access using your appKey/appSecret.

                This endpoint returns a ticket (JWT token) that you must include in all subsequent API requests.

                **Sliding Expiration Mechanism:**
                - The ticket uses a sliding expiration model - it only expires when there's no API activity
                - Maximum lifetime: 365 days (hard limit)
                - Idle timeout: Customizable via TTL parameter (default: 24 hours if not specified)
                - Active renewal: Token automatically refreshes when you make API calls
                - TTL parameter: Specifies how long the token stays valid without activity (in seconds)

                **Usage Guidelines:**
                - Cache the ticket and reuse it for all API calls
                - Do NOT call this endpoint before every API call - it's expensive and unnecessary
                - The sliding expiration is handled transparently by the server
                - Include the ticket in the Authorization header: "Bearer <ticket>"

                **Error Handling:**
                - 401: Invalid appKey/appSecret - contact your HotelByte representative
                - 401: Token expired due to inactivity - call this endpoint again to get a new ticket
                - 429: Rate limit exceeded - wait before retrying

                Verify room availability and confirm pricing before booking to prevent inventory and price changes.

                This endpoint performs a critical pre-booking validation step to ensure the selected room
                rate package is still available and the price hasn't changed since HotelRates was called.
                It's essential for preventing booking failures and price discrepancies.

                **Critical Usage Timing:**
                **MUST be called after HotelRates** when user selects a specific rate package for booking.
                This step is mandatory to prevent:
                - Room inventory depletion between search and booking
                - Price changes that could affect booking decisions
                - Booking failures due to rate package unavailability

                **Required Parameters:**
                - **ratePkgId**: The specific rate package ID selected from HotelRates response
                - **sessionId (in Header)**: The session ID for tracking the booking process

                **Response Features:**
                - Confirmed availability status
                - Final pricing information
                - Updated rate package details
                - Smart booking fallback options (R2 candidates)

                **Error Handling:**
                - Returns ARIChangedErr if inventory or price has changed
                - Provides updated pricing information when changes occur
                - Enables smart booking fallback to alternative suppliers

                **Booking Flow Integration:**
                1. Call HotelRates to get available room options
                2. User selects a specific rate package
                3. **Call CheckAvail to verify selection** ← This step
                4. Proceed with booking if availability confirmed
                5. Handle ARIChangedErr if changes detected

                **Common Use Cases:**
                - Pre-booking availability confirmation
                - Final price verification before payment
                - Smart booking fallback preparation
                - Inventory change detection

                Get destination information (standard or detailed) by destination ancestor ID or country code.

                This endpoint provides hierarchical destination data for hotel booking applications. You can retrieve destinations by either specifying a parent destination ID or a country code.

                **Query Methods:**
                1. **By Parent Destination ID**: Get all sub-destinations under a specific destination
                - Use `parentDestinationId` parameter
                - Returns immediate children of the specified destination
                - Useful for building location hierarchies (e.g., cities within a state)

                2. **By Country Code**: Get all destinations within a specific country
                - Use `countryCode` parameter (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, e.g., "US", "CN")
                - Returns top-level destinations for the specified country
                - `parentDestinationId` is ignored when `countryCode` is provided

                **Response Detail Levels:**
                - `standard` (default): Basic destination metadata and hierarchy information
                - `details`: Includes coordinates and full hierarchical relationships

                **Common Use Cases:**
                - Building location selection dropdowns in booking forms
                - Implementing progressive location disclosure (country → state → city)
                - Geographic search autocomplete functionality

                **Performance Notes:**
                - Response is cached for optimal performance
                - Large countries may return many destinations; consider pagination for UI

                Query hotel booking orders with comprehensive filtering and critical post-booking verification.

                This endpoint provides essential order status verification capabilities, particularly crucial
                for handling booking timeouts and network errors. It enables comprehensive order tracking
                and status confirmation to prevent financial losses and booking conflicts.

                **Critical Usage for Network Error Recovery:**
                **ESSENTIAL**: If Book API encounters timeout or network errors, wait for processing completion
                then call QueryOrders with the customerReferenceNo to verify order status.

                **Important Processing Timeline:**
                - Book API requires processing time to complete all backend operations
                - Typical processing window: 3-10 minutes for full completion
                - Use exponential backoff strategy for optimal response time
                - This balances quick detection with processing completion assurance

                **This approach prevents:**
                - Double bookings due to unclear order state
                - Financial losses from unconfirmed transactions
                - Customer service issues from booking uncertainties
                - Data inconsistency between client and server

                **Recommended Parameters:**
                - **customerReferenceNos**: Customer reference numbers from Book API (recommended for timeout recovery)

                **Optional Filtering Criteria:**
                - **platformReferenceNos**: Platform internal reference numbers
                - **supplierReferenceNos**: Supplier-generated reference numbers
                - **statusList**: Filter by order status (confirmed, cancelled, pending, etc.)
                - **checkInTimeWindow**: Filter by check-in date range
                - **checkOutTimeWindow**: Filter by check-out date range
                - **bookingTimeWindow**: Filter by booking creation date range
                - **freeCancelTimeWindow**: Filter by free cancel date range
                - **cancelledTimeWindow**: Filter by cancellation date range

                **Response Features:**
                - Complete order details with current status
                - Booking confirmation information
                - Payment and cancellation details
                - Supplier reference numbers

                **Network Error Recovery Workflow:**
                1. Book API returns timeout/network error
                2. **Implement exponential backoff retry strategy:**
                - Immediately call QueryOrders once (quick detection)
                - If order found: Stop - booking likely succeeded
                - If no order: Wait 30 seconds, retry
                - If still no order: Wait 1 minute, retry
                - If still no order: Wait 2 minutes, retry
                - Continue doubling wait time up to 10 minutes maximum

                3. Check order status in each response
                4. If confirmed: Process as successful booking
                5. If pending: Continue retry cycle
                6. If failed after 10 minutes: Retry Book API if appropriate

                **Exponential Backoff Benefits:**
                - Immediate detection of successful bookings
                - Gradual increase in wait time for processing completion
                - Efficient resource usage with balanced response time
                - Prevents overwhelming the system with rapid queries

                **Rate Limiting:**
                - Subject to rate limiting for high-volume queries
                - Returns 429 error for excessive requests
                - Use judiciously during error recovery scenarios

                **Common Use Cases:**
                - Post-booking status verification after network errors
                - Order status tracking and monitoring
                - Customer service order inquiries
                - Booking confirmation verification
                - Financial reconciliation and auditing
